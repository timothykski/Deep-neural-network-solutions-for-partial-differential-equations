# Deep neural network solutions for high dimensional partial differential equations 
## Applications in pricing & hedging 
Codebase for solving high-dimensional PDEs in financial mathematics using deep learning. Combines Kolmogorov PDE framework, FBSDEs, and methods like NAIS-Net, Euler-Maruyama, and Crank-Nicolson. Includes analytical tools like Ito's Lemma, Fourier Transform, and Cholesky Decomposition. Key libraries: PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy.
